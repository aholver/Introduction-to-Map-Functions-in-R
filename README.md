# Introduction-to-Map-Functions-in-R
Have you ever needed a function to be applied to multiple elements, such as datasets? Perhaps you want to run the same regression on different subsets of data. Or maybe you want to compare how different models perform against each other. Instead of copy and pasting your code repeatedly, `map()` functions can do this for you! In this workshop, we will review the structure and uses of lists. Then, we will discuss how map functions work with lists and how these functions can be used to streamline your workflow.

## Slides 
The HTML slides provide an overview a four part overview for getting acquianted with `map` functions: 
1) Atomic Vectors 
2) Lists 
3) Vectorized Operations (aka `map` Functions)
4) Practical Application 

The slides include practice and solutions. 

## Data 
Included is also a simulated `csv` file which allows you to follow along during the `Practical Application` section.

## Figures 
The folder contains figures that are featured in the slides. I included the images for those who with to have a closer look at them, instead of just on the slide.
